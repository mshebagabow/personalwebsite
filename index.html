          During the summers my family always enjoys spending time at the camp located just along the Long Lake; the only way we get to the camp is by boat and the kids love the boat ride. There we have a big fire and sit around and enjoy the evening roasting weiners and telling stories to our children and talking about our memories, these nights are filled with laughter and creating wonderful memories for our children to remember, so that they can tell to their children in the future.
          In the winter we usually go sliding right in out little community, and we also go for walks in the bush to check the traps that my husband sets, we also go on ski-doo rides. I strive to create happy and loving memories for our family.
