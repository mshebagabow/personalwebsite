        <p class="aboutparagraph">I am a ojibway woman from a community called <em>Long Lake #58 First Nation</em> where I grew up in; Although I moved to Thunder Bay and Ginoogaming First Nation in between as a child. I currently residing in Ginoogaming First Nation with my spouse Jeremiah Towigishig and my 4 beautiful children; Lawrence, Lewis, Meila, and Murphy.They are all awesome kids that hold their own unique personalities. My family enjoys spending their time outdoors, especially my husband Jeremiah and my oldest son Lawrence. They are love their passion in trapping, snaring, and fishing. By teaching our kids how to live off the land we are In 2015 I have graduated from a <strong>Early Childhood Education Program</strong> which was offered through the <em>Oshki  Pimache-O-Win Learning and Training Center</em> which is in partnership with multiple College programs, but I recieved my diploma from <em>Cambrian College,</em>. I was a Employee as a <strong>Teacher's Aide and a Registered Early Childhood Educator</strong> within Long Lake #58 First Nation from 2014/2017. Although I've had taken time off to take care of my children's well-being and mine, also to concentrate on creating a stronger bond as a family.  I'm a great person who is kind, loving, caring, and respectful. I strive to live a good healthy life, free from substance abuse and alcohol abuse that has been a constant barrier throughout my life; I may not be perfect but its the will to change for the better that counts. I consistently remind myself the benefits from excluding that lifestyle out of my life and my families; the cons are what pushes me to continue down the path which my life journey is suppose to be. th I'm a independant person who holds her life values strong. I love spending time with my children and showing them the values in life such as showing respect to themselves and others and the importance of life, wildlife, and land; the value of love and caring towards themselve and towards others. I'm from the ojibwa culture and currently learning our traditional ways and life which I will teach to my children.

          During the summers my family always enjoys spending time at the camp located just along the Long Lake; the only way we get to the camp is by boat and the kids love the boat ride. There we have a big fire and sit around and enjoy the evening roasting weiners and telling stories to our children and talking about our memories, these nights are filled with laughter and creating wonderful memories for our children to remember, so that they can tell to their children in the future.
          In the winter we usually go sliding right in out little community, and we also go for walks in the bush to check the traps that my husband sets, we also go on ski-doo rides. I strive to create happy and loving memories for our family.
