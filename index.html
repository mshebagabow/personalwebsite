        <p class="aboutparagraph">I am a ojibway woman from a community called Long Lake #58 First Nation where I grew up; Although I moved to Thunder Bay and Ginoogaming First Nation in between as a child. I am currently residing in the town of Longlac. I gave birth to 4 beautiful children and their names are: Lawrence, Lewis, Meila, and Murphy.They are all awesome kids that hold their own unique personalities. My family enjoys spending their time outdoors. My oldest son is currently interested in creating video memes of his favourite hip-hop artists, he enjoys spending time with his siblings and being a big brother.  Lawrence has a passion for trapping, snaring, and fishing; he was taught the traditional life style from his father Jeremiah Towegishig, uncles and cousins. Our family and communities believe it’s important to teach our kids how to live off the land because it teaches our children the qualities of independance, respect, and survival skills; along with many other great values of life. In 2015 I graduated from an Early Childhood Education Program which was offered through the Oshki Pimache-O-Win Learning and Training Center, in partnership with multiple College programs, but I received my diploma from Cambrian College. In the past years I've held a position as a Early Childhood Educator within Long Lake #58 First Nation from 2014 - 2018. I'm a great person who is kind, loving, caring, and respectful. I care deeply about the care of my children and creating a stronger bond as a family. I strive to live a good healthy life; overcame a lot of barriers and struggles throughout my life that made me the person I am today. I may not be perfect but it’s the will to change for the better that counts. I'm an independent person who holds her life values strong. I love spending time with my children and teaching them the values of life; such as showing respect to themselves and others, the importance of life, wildlife, and land. I continually show them the importance of loving and caring for themselves and towards others. I'm from the ojibway culture and currently learning our traditional ways and life which I will teach to my children.

          During the summers my family enjoys spending time at the camp located just along the Long Lake; we get to the camp by a boat because it is the only way to access it. The kids always love the boat ride. We always make a big camp fire to sit around and enjoy the evening roasting weiners, telling stories, and talking about our memories. These nights are filled with laughter and creating wonderful memories with family; I love creating wonderful and fun memories with family so that the next generation can tell stories and experiences to their children in the future.
          In the winter we usually go sliding right in out little community, and we also go for walks in the bush to enjoy the scenery and learn about the surrounding environment, we also go on ski-doo rides. I strive to create happy and loving memories for our family.
